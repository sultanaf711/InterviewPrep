    What they want to know: Is your experience real, progressive, and aligned to this role?
  </div>
</div>

<div class="face back">
  <div class="answer">
    I currently work as a Portfolio Release Train Engineer and Tech Program Management Manager
    at GSK, supporting the R&D Tech portfolio. My role focuses on portfolio-level execution,
    release governance, and improving delivery predictability across multiple Agile Release
    Trains in a regulated pharma environment.<br><br>

    Earlier in my career at Infosys and EdgeVerve, I worked extensively on execution, delivery,
    and support and maintenance of large-scale financial banking platforms for clients like
    HPB, ANZ, and ICICI. I started in core development and production support, and gradually
    transitioned into delivery and support leadership roles, working closely with senior
    leadership, product directors, and engineering teams for ARB/BRB and CAB-driven change
    decisions.<br><br>

    That journey from hands-on execution to portfolio-level delivery has shaped how I work
    today. Alongside delivery, I place strong emphasis on release readiness, stability signals
    from defect and incident trends, and ensuring operational learnings are reflected in
    planning and prioritization.<br><br>

    Today, my accountability is largely through delivery and release governance. This role
    allows me to focus more directly and formally on service reliability, support maturity,
    and product lifecycle stability—areas I already work closely with and now want to deepen.
  </div>

  <div class="intent">
    Intent reinforced: Show credibility, leadership progression, and readiness for service ownership.
  </div>

  <div class="validate">
    Validates: seniority, regulated experience, internal mobility readiness

          You come from a delivery and RTE background. This role is heavily support- and

          I understand that concern. While my background is rooted in delivery, my transition
          into leadership roles exposed me deeply to production support and stability
          responsibilities alongside execution.<br><br>

          What that experience taught me is that delivery and service ownership are not
          competing priorities. Delivery decisions that ignore defect and incident learnings
          eventually slow teams down and increase risk.<br><br>

          In my current role, even when delivery is the primary accountability, I actively use
          defect trends and incident insights to influence planning, risk discussions, and
          release decisions. This role allows me to apply that same mindset more formally, where

          <b>Situation:</b> In a regulated pharma IT environment, the support team was heavily
          incident-driven, with frequent urgent requests from business stakeholders. This
          limited the team’s ability to address problem backlog items linked to repeat incidents
          and operational risk.<br><br>

          while continuing to support critical business needs, without bypassing validation or

          <b>Action:</b> I ensured all work was clearly categorized and aligned to ITSM processes.
          I worked with ITSM and QA partners to identify backlog items with regulatory or patient
          impact and protected capacity to address those first. Incident trends and repeat
          failures were used to influence prioritization discussions with product and business
          stakeholders, framing decisions in terms of compliance risk and service continuity
          rather than urgency alone.<br><br>

          <b>Result:</b> Over time, repeat incidents reduced, backlog items with compliance impact
          were addressed more consistently, and prioritization discussions became more structured
          and audit-safe. The service moved toward a more stable and predictable operating model.

        This is a common challenge in high-availability environments, and the risk is that teams

        My approach would be to protect a small but consistent portion of team capacity for
        problem resolution, rather than allowing incidents to consume all available effort.
        Even in a team of eight, reserving limited capacity for backlog and RCA work helps
        break the cycle of repeat incidents.<br><br>

        I would shift the focus from repeated workarounds toward strategic, durable fixes by
        using incident trends and root cause analysis to identify the few issues driving the
        majority of incidents.<br><br>

        Finally, I would work closely with Product Owners and business stakeholders to align

          <b>Situation:</b><br>
          In my current role, I operate in a highly regulated R&amp;D Tech environment where delivery,
          operational stability, and compliance intersect. While my formal accountability is portfolio
          delivery and release governance, many decisions directly impact service reliability and
          audit readiness.<br><br>

          <b>Task:</b><br>
          My responsibility was to progress delivery without increasing operational or compliance
          risk, while ensuring incident trends, QA learnings, and post-release signals influenced
          planning and lifecycle decisions.<br><br>

          <b>Action:</b><br>
          I deliberately worked across delivery, QA, ITSM, and engineering boundaries. I used defect
          and incident trends to inform release readiness, partnered with QA to ensure traceability,
          and reframed prioritization discussions around business continuity, recurrence risk, and
          audit impact rather than urgency alone. I also applied structured incident and governance
          practices learned from regulated banking environments and adapted them to pharma quality
          expectations.<br><br>

          <b>Result:</b><br>
          Release decisions became more risk-aware, recurring issues surfaced earlier, and operational
          stability became a shared accountability rather than a post-delivery concern. This role

          While my formal accountability today is portfolio delivery and release governance,
          I consistently operate with a service-ownership lens. I actively use incident trends,

          I bring experience from highly regulated banking environments, where end-to-end
          delivery and production support were tightly coupled, and I’ve adapted that discipline
          to pharma quality and GxP expectations at GSK.<br><br>

          As a result, I don’t see service stability as something that starts after delivery.
          I integrate it into lifecycle decisions upfront. This role formalizes responsibilities
          I already practice and allows me to deepen hands-on ownership of service reliability

          I support validation readiness by ensuring delivery scope aligns with IQ/OQ/PQ
          documentation, QA review timelines, and traceability expectations before release
          approval. I partner with QA to surface gaps early rather than post-release.
